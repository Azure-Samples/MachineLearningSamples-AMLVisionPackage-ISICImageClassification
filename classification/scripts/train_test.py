      a sample pipeline for classification.

      loads a dataset, optionally does some augmentations, creates and trains a
      model using transfer learning based on ResNet18, and returns the accuracy
      on a test set.

      Args:
        dataset_location: path to a dataset.  there should be a top level folder
          containing folders for each class.  see the sample recycling dataset for
          an example of the format

        do_augmentations: boolean.  specifies whether augmentations should be

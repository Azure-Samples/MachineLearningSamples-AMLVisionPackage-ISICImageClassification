    "<b>Introduction:</b></n>\n",
    "\n",
    "Operationalization is the process of publishing models and code as web services and the consumption of these services to produce business results. Once your model is trained, we can deploy your trained model as a webservice for comsumption with [Azure Machine Learning CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/cli-for-azure-machine-learning). Your models can be deployed to your local machine or Azure Container Service (ACS) cluster as a webservice. You can scale your webservice with Azure Container Service (ACS) cluster. It also provides some autoscaling functionality for your webservice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Prerequisite:</b> \n",
    "   - You need an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) account with a valid subscription. You need to login to your account if you haven't done so. Change to your target subscription if you need.\n",
    "   >Azure CLI command to login: \n",
    "   `az login` \n",
    "   \n",
    "   >Azure CLI command to change subscription: \n",
    "   `az account set --subscription [your subscription name]` \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - You need an [Azure ML Model Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/model-management-overview) account. You need to set your model management account if you haven't done it before. **Note: Please create your Azure Machine Learning Model Management account with location of \"westcentralus\", avoiding \"eastus2\" for now (Because some locations are having deployment timeout issue, which the Azure Machine Learning CLI team is going to fix).** For more details, you can follow the instruction from this [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/deployment-setup-configuration#create-a-model-management-account) to create one. You can use this CLI command to show your active model management account: `az ml account modelmanagement show`\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   az ml account modelmanagement create -l [Azure region, e.g. westcentralus] -n [your account name] -g [resource group name] --sku-instances [number of instances, e.g. 1] --sku-name [Pricing tier for example S1]\n",
    "   az ml account modelmanagement set -n [your account name] -g [resource group it was created in]\n",
    "   ``` \n",
    "   - You need a deployment environment. If you've already set the deployment environment before running this notebook, you don't need to do it again. If you don't have one, please follow the following instruction in this [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/deployment-setup-configuration#environment-setup) to set up a deployment environment. Be sure to follow the local or cluster deployment setup steps correctly based on your need. <b>Note:</b> The local environment deployment are not supported for the Windows DSVM/DLVM today. However, local deployment is supported for Linux and Windows 10. The cluster environment deployment is supported for both Linux and Windows. You only need to set it once. You can use this CLI command to show your active deployment environment: az ml env show\n",
